# Expressive
### A programming language that resembles English.

#ToDo:
- Allow indefinite articles in titles if they are not followed a parameter name
- Decide on a variable declaration scope mode
- Check for casing at beggining of sentences, taking title parameters into account
- Add names to "AnyT" types and check them in the solver
- Should built in functions be stored as functions without sentences in the evaluator env?
